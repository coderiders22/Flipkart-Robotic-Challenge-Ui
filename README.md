## Introduction
This project presents a simple but elegant user interface that allows users to start object detection and fruit/vegetable detection tasks. The UI is built on a modern, responsive layout, with a sleek and minimalistic design that ensures ease of use and provides live feedback from the models.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Start object detection with a single click and receive visual feedback of the detected objects.
- **Fruit/Vegetable Detection**: Easily detect fruits and vegetables using a pre-trained prediction model.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes.
- **Sleek Visuals**: Modern UI with smooth animations and video backgrounds to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For handling interactivity and providing dynamic output.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
You'll need a basic text editor and a modern web browser. No additional software installations are required.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-vision-system.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd smart-vision-system
    ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
    Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it via your browser by right-clicking and selecting “Open With.”

Alternatively, if you're running a local server (e.g., using VS Code Live Server), you can use that as well.

### Usage
1. Once the page is loaded, you'll see two sections:
    - **Object Detection**: Click "Start" to detect objects. The result will appear within a few seconds.
    - **Fruit/Vegetable Detection**: Click "Start" to detect fruits or vegetables. The prediction will be displayed after detection.

2. The output is updated live based on the simulated model response in JavaScript.
